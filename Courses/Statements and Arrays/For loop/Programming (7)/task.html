  <p>A detector compares the size of parts produced by a machine with the reference standard. </p>
  <p>If the size of the part is <b>larger</b>, it can be sent to be fixed, and the detector prints the number 1.<br>If the size of the part is <b>smaller</b>, it is removed as reject, and the detector prints the number -1.<br>If the part was made <b>perfect</b>, it is sent to the box with ready products, and the detector prints 0.</p>
  <p>Write a program, which takes the number of parts <b><i>n</i></b> as input, and then the sequence of detector prints. The program should output numbers in a single line â€“ the number of ready parts, the number of parts to be fixed, and the number of rejects.</p>
