  <p><b>Healthy sleep</b></p> 
  <p>Ann watched a TV program about health and learned that it is recommended to sleep at least <span class="math-tex">\( A \)</span> hours per day, but oversleeping is also not healthy and you should not sleep more than <span class="math-tex">\( B \)</span> hours.</p>
  <p>Now Ann sleeps <span class="math-tex">\( H \)</span> hours per day. Determine if her sleep schedule complies with the requirements of that TV program. If it does, print <b>Normal</b>. If Ann sleeps fewer than <span class="math-tex">\( A \)</span> hours, output <b>Deficiency</b>. If she sleeps more than <span class="math-tex">\( B \)</span> hours, output <b>Excess</b>.</p> 
  <p>User inputs three strings with variables in the following order: <span class="math-tex">\( A \)</span>, <span class="math-tex">\( B \)</span>, <span class="math-tex">\( H \)</span>. <span class="math-tex">\( A \)</span> is always less than or equal to <span class="math-tex">\( B \)</span>.</p> 
  <p>Please note the output should exactly correspond to what is required in the problem, including case-sensitivity. For example, output such as "excess", "EXCESS", "ExCeSs" and others will not be graded as correct.</p> 
  <p>Think carefully about all the conditions you need to use. Pay special attention to the strictness of the conditional operators you use: distinguish between &lt; and ≤; &gt; and ≥. To understand which ones to use, re-read the problem if necessary.</p>
